# Github Issues App

Project to practice the React Query library. We will use the [Github Api](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/issues/labels?apiVersion=2022-11-28) to be able to bring the issues from a specific repository, in this case, from the [React repository](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues). The objective is to learn how to manage the cache, segment it and order it for better reading and understanding.
